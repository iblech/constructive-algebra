# constructive-algebra
Haskell library for dealing with algebraic numbers and Galois groups

In need of serious cleanup. The code is thoroughly commented, but only in
German. This will be fixed.

Check http://speicherleck.de/iblech/stuff/swprak-algebra/ for a demo of this
library. The highlight is calculation of Galois groups of polynomials over Q,
by using arbitrary-precision arithmetic.

Note: When experimenting, use commit d1880d5f. All tests work at this commit.
The next few commits point to a good direction, but are work in progress.
You can also check out the continued-fractions branch.
